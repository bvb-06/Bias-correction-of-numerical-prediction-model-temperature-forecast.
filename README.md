Consider the "Bias correction of numerical prediction model temperature forecast Data
Set" in https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bias+correction+of+numerical+
prediction+model+temperature+forecast. Please read the data description in the link.
You can also download its data as a csv le from the "Data Folder" in this link.
This data set includes 7750 observations and 25 attributes. The last two attributes
(Next Tmax and Next Tmin) are the response variables that we want to predict. We will
